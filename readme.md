#Useful quake modding stuff repo

This is a small repo for making public useful stuff for quake modding.
At present, it just contains a mostly-improved version of the hipnotic fgd for use in Trenchbroom.

hipnotic-new.fgd is a modified fgd which exposes options in the modified quakec (source in hipnotic-new ; eventually a source compatible with the rerelease quakc in hipnotic-new-rerelease).

All quakec code is originally Copyright Id Software, released GPLv2.
Modifications by me [license is, of course, GPLv2 still]
